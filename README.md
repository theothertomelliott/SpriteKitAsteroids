SpriteKitAsteroids
==================

An Asteroids clone built to get to grips with SpriteKit on iOS

As a clone, this is very basic, currently missing the hyperspace/shield option and flying saucers. But the old game dynamics we know and love are there.

Dependencies
============

Aside from the iOS SDK, this project uses [CGVector-Awesome](https://github.com/samgreen/CGVector-Awesome) a handy vector maths header by [samgreen](https://github.com/samgreen), and a [modified version of JCInput](https://github.com/theothertomelliott/JCInput), based on [JCInput](https://github.com/jsedano/JCInput) by [jsedano](https://github.com/jsedano/JCInput). Both are included as subrepositories.

Building
========

The XCode project should build out of the box with XCode 5+ and the iOS 7 SDK.

Forking/Contributing
====================

This was a learning exercise for me, so feel free to take a fork and learn what you can too! Contributions are also welcome, just send a pull request.
